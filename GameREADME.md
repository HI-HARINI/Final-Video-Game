Title: Rocket Ships Obstacles

Description and How to Play: Use you track pad to avoid the obstacles thrown at the space ship. 

Scripts: Player Controller - for the rocketship  AND  Obstacle - for the hexagons

Proud: of the code I made to display the button and score

Challenges: Navigating Unity but solved it by following tutorials

The game itself meets all the requirements. But instead of importing a already made script I made my own. I added many components like obstacles, score, restart button etc. Since I made it from scratch their were no in code comments. Also instead of a win function I did a lose function if thats okay.
